# Cryptocurrencies - Unsupervised Machine Learning
Machine Learning Unsupervised Analysis of Cryptocurrencies.

#### Overview
A set of Unsupervised algorithms to make analysis and predictions. 

###### Resources

#### Challenge
The purpose of this project is to analyze a set of trading cryptocurrencies in order to group them according to their possible similarities. This classification will help to make decisions to build an investment portfolio with these currencies.
For his purpose, several steps have been followed:
* **Preprocessing of the data** - to prepare our original dataset to meet the requirements of the algorithms to use.
* **Data dimensions reduction** - Using PCA, the total dimension of the dataset will be reduced to a certain lower number.
* **Cluster cryptocurrencies** - Using K-Means, the data will be clustered in a precalculated optimal number of groups.
* **Graphical Display** - The results will be displayed on a table and two scatter plots to easily visualize the output of the model.
